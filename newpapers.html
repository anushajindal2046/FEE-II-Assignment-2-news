            The Narendra Modi government on Friday rejected Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin over his allegation of Tamil Nadu being neglected in sanction of 
          projects by the Centre.
          “Statement of chief minister is far from the truth and as a matter of fact, the present NDA government has significantly increased the funding of 
          projects on railways , highways, airports, 
          and also in schemes in the social and rural sectors in Tamil Nadu in the last 10 years,” sources in the government told HT.

                    Now, the Centre has allotted a record budget of ₹6,331 crore for railways to the state in 2024-25.

According to a report in The Telegraph, one of the frontrunners to replace Gambhir as KKR's mentor is South African great and the franchise's former coach Jacques Kallis.

        <br>Sometimes, all we want is our comfort content; to immerse ourselves in a fictional world we know and love. But instead of championing new voices, instead of returning to those original, familiar stories, Hollywood wants us to consume new takes on old sh*t—in turn, ruining our tried-and-true comfort watches.

        Would I rewatch Friends or The O.C. if I knew the story would continue 20+ years later? Do we need to see Remy's life at his bistro in a potential Ratatouille 2? Probably not. These standalone stories are perfect as they are. Even when franchises end on a perfectly satisfying note with all lingering storylines complete, there's a high chance some executive will decide on a whim that the story should be prolonged, no matter if it's been less than a decade since its end. Nostalgia might be at an all-time high, but familiarity breeds contempt, and some things are better left untouched.
        
        In the past 7 days alone, we,ve gotten confirmation of Devil Wears Prada 2, Freaky Friday 2, and Shrek 5. Over the past few months, there,s also been Legally Blonde 2, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, a Harry Potter series remake with a whopping seven seasons coming to Max, a new Beverly Hills Cop hitting Netflix…

Faced with an explosion of retail options, the rise of online platforms with instant delivery timelines, and the influx of international luxury brands to the Indian market, fashion stores are now stepping beyond the template of a traditional retailer to curate offbeat events ranging from music gigs to art shows to food trails.

                “We want people to walk into our store and feel like they,re in a really cool basement or art gallery, where they can discover something new”, explains Capsul,s co-founder Bhavisha Dave. The brainchild of former brand marketeers Dave and Meenakshi Singh, Capsul,s carefully curated stores across Mumbai, Bangalore, and Ahmedabad regularly serve as backdrops for tattoo workshops, b-boy showcases, and even sushi takeovers. “Friendships and even love stories have started through our events,” Dave says with a laugh.

            <br>Sometimes, all we want is our comfort content; to immerse ourselves in a fictional world we know and love. But instead of championing new voices, instead of returning to those original, familiar stories, Hollywood wants us to consume new takes on old sh*t—in turn, ruining our tried-and-true comfort watches.
    
            Would I rewatch Friends or The O.C. if I knew the story would continue 20+ years later? Do we need to see Remy's life at his bistro in a potential Ratatouille 2? Probably not. These standalone stories are perfect as they are. Even when franchises end on a perfectly satisfying note with all lingering storylines complete, there's a high chance some executive will decide on a whim that the story should be prolonged, no matter if it's been less than a decade since its end. Nostalgia might be at an all-time high, but familiarity breeds contempt, and some things are better left untouched.

                    <br>The brand is part of a rising crop of homegrown labels reimagining their physical stores as spaces of cultural discovery that bring together a community. Faced with an explosion of retail options, the rise of online platforms with instant delivery timelines, and the influx of international luxury brands to the Indian market, fashion stores are now stepping beyond the template of a traditional retailer to curate offbeat events ranging from music gigs to art shows to food trails.
    
                    “We want people to walk into our store and feel like they,re in a really cool basement or art gallery, where they can discover something new”, explains Capsul,s co-founder Bhavisha Dave. The brainchild of former brand marketeers Dave and Meenakshi Singh, Capsul,s carefully curated stores across Mumbai, Bangalore, and Ahmedabad regularly serve as backdrops for tattoo workshops, b-boy showcases, and even sushi takeovers. “Friendships and even love stories have started through our events,” Dave says with a laugh.

        President Biden faced a fresh wave of pressure on Wednesday to end his campaign or rethink his decision to run for reelection, as Democrats from Hollywood to Capitol Hill aired grave concerns that he would lose to former president Donald Trump in November and drag his party's chance of controlling Congress down with him.
